# CS 300 Portfolio
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   I built a program for ABCU that helped their advisors manage their course info. 

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   In the beginning of this course, I was not confident in data structures at all. However, the milestones were actually really helpful in figuring out the vectors, hash tables, and BSTs. By understanding the pros and cons of each of the structures,    it helped me to make a better recommendation for the final project. In the end, I decided to recommend a binary search tree because of how to sorts things automatically and makes the printing much easeir. 

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   There were many moments when I felt very stuck trying to get Apporto to cooperate. It helped to break things into smaller, more managable steps. Also, the pseudocode was stressful in the moment, but did help shape my code into somethiing that        would build and run properly. Also, to overcome my lack of experience in C++, I did have to spend extra time on YouTube trying to figure out how to properly code this assignment. 

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   This project really helped me see the importance of planning before going straight into coding. I have worked with pseudocodes before, but this was the first time that they made this course feel much less overwhelming. The Big-O analysis made me     think more about how to approach algorithmic design. I realize that I don't actually think in a recursive way, which is something I want to work on since it limits how I approach certain issues. 

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   I think all the elements come from practice. After writing many streams throughout this course, I started to create muscle memory and recognize patterns in what I kept reusing.
